<p>Howdy!</p>
<p>My name is Jaideep Rana, the author of Jd's tech blog. I'm a software developer with a passion for
  technology and learning. Currently I'm working in Gurugram. I started my career in 2012 and have been enjoying the
journey so far.</p>


<p>I love reading and growing. I have started this blog to share my knowledge to the aspiring geeks, and give
  something back to the community.</p>

<p>Hope you are enjoying the blog so far. Tune in for more content, and thank you for vising the blog.</p>
