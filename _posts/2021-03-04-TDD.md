## Quick disclaimer

This blog post covers the theoretical part of TDD. For a practical example, I'll be uploading a video in a separate blog
post and provide a link to it.

## What is TDD?

To put in simple terms, TDD is a style software development where we start from writing a failing test first, then
writing bare minimum code to make it pass and then doing refactoring if required.

![TDD cycle](/img/posts/TDD/TDD_cycle.png)

## Pros
* Helps to make the programmer productive by forcing them to focus on the small segment of the code. Also, because we
  start with small tests and evolve both the tests and code on our way, it becomes easier to debug the issues as the
  test themselves reveal the reason for failure.
* Helps to create a better design. (Because in TDD we start by writing the tests first and refactor the code once the
  test passes. Starting with a failing test helps because that way it forces us to think about the consumer code first.
  If something is hard to test, usually it's usually due to bad design.)
* Helps the programmer get into a flow and keep them motivated. (Because we are focusing on a small problem, it doesn't
  place too much load on the cognition and because of the dopamine rush of seeing the test pass, it gives motivation
  boost)
* Gives programmers confidence in their code and freedom to do merciless refactoring. The tests act like a safety net.
* Because it advocates fail fast philosophy, one can get quite fast one they get comfortable using it.
* Newer way of thinking and solving the problem. As per pragmatic learning book, it forces us to use synthetic way of
  thinking. Leonardo da vinci quote: To develop a complete mind study the art of science similarly study the science of
  art.
* Can be combined with pair-programming. In this case, one person writes the test and then passes on the keyboard to the
  other one. The refactoring step requires collaboration and can be done by either of the parties but it's desired that
  they rotate the work.
* Living documentation.

## Cons
* Takes some time for beginners to adapt. TDD is a mindset and requires discipline. It takes time, effort and deliberate
  practice making it a second nature and to reap out the benefits. As per pragmatic learning book, it forces us to use
  synthetic way of analyzing a problem instead of analyzing. It's a different way of solving problem and as per the
  author and me, it's efficient and fun way of solving problem.

## Common mistakes people do when doing TDD?

### Not following the discipline properly

If you are not following the cycle of TDD i.e red, green and refactor in the given order then you are not doing TDD.

You need to write a failing test before making it pass. Similarly you need to follow refactor step else TDD won't lead
to a better design.

### Not writing minimal code to make the test pass

Good programs solves the problem, great ones prevent them. Any code that you write is a liability. Therefore, we should
write bare-minimum code to make the test pass.

### Not giving it enough time

If don't practice something, you won't learn it. And if you don't learn it, you won't get the benefit out of it. TDD
requires consistent time and effort. If you feel it's not making you productive, you haven't given it enough time.
Eventually with time, you will discover that it makes you develop programs much FASTER and with much EASE.

### Not giving the test code the respect it deserves

Your tests are your live documentation. They scream the usecase/requirement to the readers. Therefore it's important
that you treat them with the same respect, if not more that you give to production code. That include ensure you don't
have code duplication in your test. The only exception to this rule is test readability. If for any reason you have to
chose between code readability and code duplication in terms of tests, then always go for readability. Because reading
and understanding code is more expensive.

Also I would recommend you to use the arrange, act and assert way of writing the tests. That makes it easier for read to
differentiate the data-population part, the code in action part and the assertion part.

### Not doing it in the front end

TDD can be applied to both front end and backend. Usually if something is hard to test, it's because of bad design. For
e.g. in react's world common business logic can be extracted into hooks. That way unit testing them becomes easier. With
React testing library you can mock the components being used in the component under test. That way testing them becomes
easier. Again if something is difficult to test, it forces us to think about our approach. Taking the same react
example, if we start with small components then it will make testing easier.

### Conclusion

I can write so much about the topic but I don't want to overwhelm my readers. I hope by now, you have some idea about
TDD. In case you are someone who thinks they are doing TDD, I hope you are able to identify some mistake you are doing
or are at least aware of the common ones that people do. This way you will be response back whenever someone say that
TDD isn't working for them.
