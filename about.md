Howdy!

My name is Jaideep Rana, the author of Jd's tech blog. I'm a software developer with a passion for technology and
learning. Currently I'm working in Gurugram. I started my career in 2012 and have been enjoying the journey so far.

I love reading and growing. I have started this blog to share my knowledge to the aspiring geeks, and give something
back to the community.

Hope you are enjoying the blog so far. Tune in for more content, and thank you for vising the blog.
